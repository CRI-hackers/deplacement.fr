## Deplacement.fr

A very simple test deployment can be found at https://cri-hackers.github.io/deplacement.fr/test_deployment/

Right now there's no changes to the original submission (except that the date/time is editable when submitting as we're getting rid of the CSS-implemented barriers). 

#### Local dev
Interestingly the local dev version does not properly check the boxes, at least not on Mac OS X. I assume there's some weirdness going on with local PDF generation (actually, the PDFs generated on my Mac have proper checkboxes for the reasons, while the remote-generated don't?). 

So yeah, if in doubt checkout the GH pages version.
